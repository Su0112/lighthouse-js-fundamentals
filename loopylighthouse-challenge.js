// Then, start working on your program by writing a loop that prints out all the numbers from 100 to 200, inclusive. Only move on to the next step when that works.

// Next, pick a condition you want to start with, for example printing out "Loopy" instead of multiples of 3. Figure out how you're going to check whether a number is a multiple of 3, then write your if statement. To verify that it works, consider calculating a few multiples of 3 by hand in a notebook (for example, 102, 105, 108, etc.), then making sure they're being replaced with "Loopy" in your output.

// Repeat the previous step with your remaining conditions one at a time until they all work. It may help you be confident in your result if you've also calculated by hand a few multiples of 4 and a few of both 3 and 4.
const i = "";

for (let i = 100; i <= 200; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 4 === 0) {
    console.log("LoopyLighthouse");
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Loopy");
  } else if (i % 4 === 0) {
    console.log("Lighthouse");
  } else console.log(i);
